# Adaboosting From Scratch

## What is AdaBoosting?

AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is a machine learning algorithm that improves the performance of other learning algorithms by combining multiple "weak" learning models into a single "strong" model. This is achieved by training a series of weak models, each of which focuses on accurately identifying the examples that the preceding models misclassified. The final model is a weighted average of each weak model, with the weights determined by the performance of each model. This approach allows for the creation of a strong model that is able to accurately classify examples that may be difficult for individual weak models to handle.
