## What is a Hidden Markov Model?

A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical model that is used to mathematically represent a sequence of observations. It is called a "hidden" Markov model because the underlying process that generates the observations is assumed to be a Markov process, but the specific state of the process is not directly observable. This model is often used to infer the hidden state of the underlying process given a sequence of observations.

## Baum-Welch Forward-Backward Algorithm

This project employed the Baum-Welch Forward-Backward Algorithm, also known as the Baum-Welch expectation-maximization algorithm. This algorithm is a technique for estimating the parameters of a Hidden Markov Model. It iteratively performs two steps: a "forward" step and a "backward" step. The forward step calculates the probability of the observed sequence of emitting states, given the current estimates of the model parameters. The backward step calculates the probability of the observed sequence of emitting states in reverse order, starting from the end of the sequence and working backwards to the beginning, and using the current estimates of the model parameters. These two probabilities are then combined using the expectation-maximization (EM) principle to update the estimates of the model parameters. This process is repeated until the estimates of the model parameters converge to a stable value.

## How can Hidden Markov Models be used for spellchecking?

Hidden Markov models can be utilized in spell checking by modeling the sequence of letters in a word. In this context, the hidden states in the model would correspond to the correct spelling of the word, while the emitting states would represent the sequence of letters that was observed in the input. By calculating the probability of the observed sequence of letters given the correct spelling of the word, the model can be used to identify and correct spelling errors.
